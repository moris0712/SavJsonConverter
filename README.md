This plugin provides the following core features:

- Load `.sav` files and convert them to `.json`
- Load `.json` files and convert them to `.sav`  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *The save class you're trying to convert must be declared within your module*
- Serialize and test custom save data

## üß© Custom Serialization Support

### For `UObject`-derived classes

To serialize your own `UObject`-based save classes, override the `Serialize` function and manually serialize each member variable using the archive:

### For `struct` types

For structs, overload the `operator<<` and serialize only the desired fields:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- If you've modified the `.sav` file externally (e.g., via another tool), make sure to **reload** it before attempting conversion.
- The `SaveGameClass` specified in the `.json` must be **included and declared within your project module**.
- If you want to see a test example, refer to the TestSaveData file in the Test folder.
